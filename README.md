## Branching
when making major changes to the code, please create a branch (if not done so already) then switch into it to make your changes. Once it works, you can merge into the main branch. The main branch will be the one we will submit as our final submission.

(to stage all your changes) --> git commit -m "place your update note here" (use this note to make sure everyone knows what youve changed or updated --> git push origin BRANCH (for changes to be accessible to everyone)
